\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  We show that if a planar graph $G$ has a plane straight-line drawing in
  which a subset $S$ of its vertices are collinear, then for any set of
  points, $X$, in the plane with $|X|=|S|$, there is a plane straight-line
  drawing of $G$ in which the vertices in $S$ are mapped to the points
  in $X$.  This solves an open problem posed by Ravsky and Verbitsky in
  2008.  In their terminology, we show that every collinear set is free.

  This result has applications in graph drawing, including untangling,
  column planarity, universal point subsets, and partial simultaneous
  drawings.

\section{Open Problems}

In this paper we proved that every collinear set is a free set. Several problems concerning collinear and free sets remain open. Here we mention our favorite two.

Let $f(n)$ be the minimum, over all $n$-vertex planar graphs $G$, of the size of the largest collinear set in $G$. What is the growth rate of $f(n)$? The best known bounds are $f(n)\in\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ and $f(n)\in \mathcal{O}(n^\sigma)$, for $\sigma < 0.986$ \cite{bose.dujmovic.ea:polynomial,ravsky.verbitsky:on}. Our results prove that $f(n)$ is also the minimum size of the largest free set over all $n$-vertex planar graphs; this makes determining the growth rate of $f(n)$ even more relevant. For example, any improvement in the lower bound would immediately give an improved result for untangling planar graphs.

We find it interesting to understand whether our main theorem,
\thmref{our-bang}, can be generalized so that the $y$-coordinates are arbitrarily prescribed not only for the vertices on~$Y$, but also for the crossing points of the edges with $Y$. Note that \thmref{main} {\em almost} gives this generalization, as every edge crossing $Y$ is at most $\epsilon$ away from its prescribed crossing point, for any arbitrarily small $\epsilon$.
